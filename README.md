My R is better than your R
(Verse 1)
My R brings all the stats to the yard,
And they're like, "It's better than yours."
Damn right, it's better than yours,
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.

(Chorus)
My R is better than your R,
It's got data dancing near and far.
Syntax smooth, like a melody,
In the world of stats, it's pure harmony.

(Verse 2)
See, my R code's like a fine wine,
Aged to perfection, so sublime.
Data frames sippin', ggplot sizzlin' hot,
In the world of analysis, it hits the spot.

(Chorus)
My R is better than your R,
It's got data dancing near and far.
Syntax smooth, like a melody,
In the world of stats, it's pure harmony.

(Bridge)
Tidyverse twist, dplyr bliss,
My R's got moves you can't dismiss.
From data wrangling to plots so fly,
In the analytics dance, we reach the sky.

(Verse 3)
Take a sip from the cup of regression,
Predicting outcomes with sharp precision.
In the kingdom of models, my R's the king,
While yours is playing with a puppet string.

(Chorus)
My R is better than your R,
It's got data dancing near and far.
Syntax smooth, like a melody,
In the world of stats, it's pure harmony.

(Outro)
So when you're lost in a sea of confusion,
Let my R guide you, a statistical infusion.
From data points to conclusions drawn,
In the realm of analysis, my R's the dawn.
